 Repo is mostly https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html with minor changes  
 **AND** i've added
 + .png/.jpg/etc. support using [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h)
 + Image-based-lighting (environment maps!)
 + Metaballs (to be refined, maybe)
 + Simple multithreaded rendering with OpenMP
